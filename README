This is the repository for my role-playing rogue-like game: The Sepertine Caves

The game is still in early development, but I hope to have a fully functioning
version in the near future.

I am currently redesigning the code to make use of state machines, which will
make the code more organized and make it easier to incorporate new components.

This is my current progress on the above mentioned conversion, however most
things are not working.
